# Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images as either cats or dogs. The model is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of cats and dogs, and achieves competitive performance in distinguishing between the two classes.

## Overview

This CNN model is built using [insert framework/library here, e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch] and trained on a dataset comprising thousands of cat and dog images. The goal of the model is to accurately predict whether a given image contains a cat or a dog.

## Model Architecture

The CNN architecture used for this project consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract and learn features from the input images. The final layers are fully connected to make predictions based on the learned features.

- **Input Layer:** Accepts input images of size [specify dimensions].
- **Convolutional Layers:** [Brief description of layers and filters used].
- **Pooling Layers:** Max-pooling layers to downsample feature maps.
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Dense layers for classification.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sunilthite/cat-or-dog-image-classification/data). It includes a balanced collection of cat and dog images, each labeled accordingly.

## Training

The model is trained using [specify training details]:

- **Optimizer:** [Optimizer algorithm, e.g., Adam].
- **Loss Function:** [Loss function used, e.g., Cross-Entropy].
- **Metrics:** [Evaluation metrics, e.g., Accuracy].
- **Training Steps:** [Number of epochs and batch size].

## Usage

To use the model:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `python predict.py` to classify a custom image as either a cat or a dog.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements and future work include:
- Experimenting with different architectures (e.g., transfer learning).
- Enhancing dataset diversity.
- Improving model robustness and efficiency.
